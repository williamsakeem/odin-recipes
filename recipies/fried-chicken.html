        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A quick, crispy chicken comes together with just chicken pieces, 
            salt, black pepper, flour, and hot oil: season the chicken well, 
            coat it lightly in flour, heat the oil until it’s shimmering, fry the pieces on medium heat 
            until they’re golden and cooked through, then let them rest on a rack or paper towel so they stay perfectly crunchy.
        </p>
