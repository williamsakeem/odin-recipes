    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. 
        You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, 
        but let's go over the basics: </p>   
    <p>
        
        1. Cook the meat: Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.
        <br>
        2. Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.
        <br>
        3. Make the cheese layer: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.
        <br>
        4. Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.
        <br>
        5. Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong><br>Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong><br>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, 
            deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong><br>Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong><br>Stir in crushed tomatoes, 
            tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. 
            Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong><br>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. 
            Drain and set aside. While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6</strong><br>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, 
            salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined. </li>

            Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. </li>
        <li><strong>Step 8</strong><br>Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. 
            Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. </li>
        <li><strong>Step 9</strong><br>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. 
            Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes. </li>
        <li><strong>Step 10</strong><br>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving. </li>
    </ol>
